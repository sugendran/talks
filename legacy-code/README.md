Refactoring Legacy Code
=======================


Blurb:

Is Legacy JavaScript the bane of your existence? It's not something you aim for but changes over 
time can leave the codebase in a less than ideal situation. Sugendran works in a repository that 
usually sees 30+ commits to master per day, with over 100 engineers having their fingers in it over 
the last 5 years. Recently he refactored a portion of it. This talk is about his recent experience 
refactoring the FeedList, one of the central features of Yammer that has been around for over four 
years. The ups, the downs, and the face palms.

This talk has been given at:
 * Backbone.js Meetup - London, March 2014
 * London Frontendingeers - London, April 2014
 * Scotland JS - Edinburgh, May 2014
