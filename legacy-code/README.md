Refactoring Legacy Code
=======================


Blurb:
------

Is Legacy JavaScript the bane of your existence? It's not something you aim for but changes over
time can leave the codebase in a less than ideal situation. Sugendran works in a repository that
usually sees 30+ commits to master per day, with over 100 engineers having their fingers in it over
the last 5 years. Recently he refactored a portion of it. This talk is about his recent experience
refactoring the FeedList, one of the central features of Yammer that has been around for over four
years. The ups, the downs, and the face palms.

This talk has been given at:
 * Backbone.js Meetup - London, March 2014
 * London Frontendingeers - London, April 2014
 * Scotland JS - Edinburgh, May 2014


Note:
-----

There are two versions in this repo. One is my original version and the notes for each slide contains
what I thought I was going to say. The talk was then refactored a little to bullet points which is
the ScotlandJS version.
